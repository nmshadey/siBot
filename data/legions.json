      "up": "When a Legion levels up, the owner is sent a message in the turn log. The owner must select the desired upgrade to continue. Upgrade bonuses are determined randomly and they consist of increases in combat attributes, loyalty, move points, or new special abilities. The effects of this bonus are applied at the beginning of the processing of the following turn."

      "description": "Move points determine how far a Legion may move in any given turn across the game board. For each movement point, the Legion may enter one Canton. If the Legion has a special ability that allows it to move into impassable terrain then it still expends one movement point to do so.",
      "rules": "The following rules apply to Legion movement:\n- A Canton may only contain one Legion at the end of any turn. A Legion and a Place of Power can never be in the same Canton at the end of a turn. Places of Power never move.\n- Legions may move through Cantons containing other friendly Legions or Places of Power but may never end their turn in the same Canton as another Legion or Place of Power, be it friend or foe.\n- Legions may enter the Canton of a Place of Power to initiate attack, but after battle they are placed in a random adjacent Canton. This obviously applies to a surviving Legion that either wins against the garrison or retreats into a valid Canton with some remaining health. If, for example, you fly a Legion into a Place of Power that is surrounded by enemy Cantons with whom you are not in Vendetta, Blood Feud, Excommunicated, or Blood Lord/Vassal, your Legion is eliminated after combat occurs, even if you win. This happens since there is no valid Canton for this Legion to occupy.\n- Legions may only enter the territory of another player if the correct diplomatic stance exists with that player, namely: Vendetta, Blood Feud, Excommunication, or Blood Vassal/Blood Lord."

    "special abilities": "Some Legions have special abilities that grant terrain movement bonuses or advantages in battle. Some abilities may be added to a Legion if that Legion gains a level through battle promotion. Others may come from Events.",
    "attachments": "Each Legion gains attachment slots based on its level attribute. Attachment slots may be used to place Combat Cards, Praetors, or Evil Artifacts, each of which provides special bonuses to their corresponding Legion.\n- *Legion Level 1-2:* 1 attachment slot.\n- *Legion Level 3-4:* 2 attachment slots.\n- *Legion Level 5-6:* 3 attachment slots.\n- *Legion Level 7+:* 4 attachment slots.\n\n*Note:* Only a Legion’s owner may view the bonus details provided by Combat Cards. The bonuses from any Praetors or Evil Artifacts, however, are viewable by everyone.",
    "upkeep": "Once contracted, a Legion serves for eternity or until it is destroyed or bribed away by another player. Some rare Legions require a special amount of tribute to be paid each turn in maintenance. The tribute may be paid in advance, but if a turn passes and tribute is not paid, the Legion returns to the Infernal Bazaar. It can, however, be hired by the previous owner, though the contract must be won again through successful bidding.",
    "training": "Some rare Manuscripts (those found through Tribute or bought in the Infernal Bazaar) allow Legions to upgrade their attributes; done by issuing a correlating order to the Legion through its icon or through the Orders Tab of the Ministerium Interface. The Manuscript is used like a normal Tribute Card to pay for this training, and the upgrade is applied at the beginning of the processing of the following turn."

      "description": "Most members of the Grinning Legion bear ivory or onyx horns that stud their faces around the nose or across the forehead. While possessing superhuman strength, they are considered weaker than most other demonic legions per capita. Their prowess, though, comes from volume. They are 500,000 strong, they bite through terrain which impedes movement, and they pile themselves afore structures so that their collective mass may overcome. Their name comes not from their smiles, but from the Cheshire cut that sits below the breast. The Grinning Legion were originally called Red Moons until the Nine Circles War.",
